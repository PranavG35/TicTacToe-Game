# TicTacToe-Game
A Tic Tac Toe game project involves developing a digital version of the classic two-player game where participants alternately mark Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The game includes features such as a simple, interactive interface, two-player mode on the same device, automatic win and draw detection, and an option to restart the game. The project aims to deliver an engaging and easy-to-play game experience suitable for all ages.
